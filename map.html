			<h3 id="anvil">Anvil Studios, Denham, UK</h3>

			<div class="location-profile">
				<div class="location-description"><p>Now defunct, Anvil Studios is the stage at which both Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980) were recorded at, with the London Symphony Orchestra. Anvil Studios was once a fully-featured film studio, but most of it was shut down in 1952. What remained was converted into a scoring studio in the late 60s, and was used to record several major film scores through the 70s. Anvil Studios as a scoring stage eventually shut down in 1980, shortly after ESB was recorded. All of the buildings were demolished shortly thereafter.</p></div>

			<h3 id="abbeyroad">Abbey Road Studios, London, UK</h3>
			<div class="location-profile">
				<div class="location-description"><p>Abbey Road Studios are a set of recording stages in London made famous by the Beatles in the 60s. After some financial difficulties with the orchestral Stage One in the late 70s, and with the opportunity opened by Anvil shutting down, Abbey Road started hosting film scoring sessions in 1980. It quickly became John Williams' recording home in London. Return of the Jedi was recorded there with the LSO in 1983, as were all three prequels in 1999, 2002, and 2005. Several Star Wars video game scores also recorded at Abbey Road with the LSO, such as Knights of the Old Republic II, Battlefront II, Jedi Fallen Order, and Jedi Survivor.</div>

			<h3 id="jkms">JoAnn Kane Music Service, Los Angeles, California</h3>
			<div class="location-profile">
				<div class="location-description"><p>JKMS is a music preparation service and library. They can handle orchestration, making and printing parts, conducting, and even archival and storage. They have a massive library of sheet music covering almost 100 years of film scores, including the original sheet music for every Star Wars production ever made. The owner, Mark Graham, has been present at every John Williams recording session since The Phantom Menace in 1999.</p></div>

			<h3 id="jkms">Skywalker Sound, Nicasio, California</h3>
			<div class="location-profile">
				<div class="location-description"><p>Skywalker Sound is primarily a mixing and editing studio. They've handled the sound and music editing for every Star Wars project. They also have a small scoring stage, and a couple video game scores were recorded here such as The Force Unleashed and The Old Republic. Scoring is not primarily what they do however, and most Star Wars projects were recorded elsewhere.</p></div>
			</div>	

			<h3 id="jkms">Sony Pictures Scoring Stage, Culver City, California</h3>
			<div class="location-profile">
				<div class="location-description"><p>The Sony Pictures Scoring Stage is a scoring stage on the Sony Pictures Studio lot. Despite being owned by Sony, they do allow other studios to record here. John Williams recorded all three sequel trilogy scores here with the Hollywood Studio Symphony in 2015, 2017 and 2019.</p></div>

			<h3 id="jkms">Smecky Music Studios, Prague, Czechia</h3>
			<div class="location-profile">
				<div class="location-description"><p>Smecky Music Studios is a scoring stage in Prague that has been used to record music for recent animated Star Wars projects such as Rebels and The Clone Wars, composed by Kevin Kiner and team. This is partially due to its cost effectiveness, as well as its remote scoring option, which doesn't even require travel for the composer. Typically music recorded here is played by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.</p></div>

			<h3 id="jkms">Rotenbiller Studio, Budapest, Hungary</h3>
			<div class="location-profile">
